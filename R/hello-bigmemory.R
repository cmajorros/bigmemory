#' Manage massive matrices with shared memory and memory-mapped files.
#' 
#' Create, store, access, and manipulate massive matrices.  Matrices are, by
#' default, allocated to shared memory and may use memory-mapped files.
#' Packages \pkg{biganalytics}, \pkg{synchronicity}, \pkg{bigalgebra}, and
#' \pkg{bigtabulate} provide advanced functionality.  Access to and
#' manipulation of a \code{\link{big.matrix}} object is exposed in by an S4
#' class whose interface is simlar to that of an \code{\link{matrix}}.  Use of
#' these packages in parallel environments can provide substantial speed and
#' memory efficiencies.  \pkg{bigmemory} also provides a \acronym{C++}
#' framework for the development of new tools that can work both with
#' \code{big.matrix} and native \code{matrix} objects.

#' Multi-gigabyte data sets challenge and frustrate users, even on
#' well-equipped hardware. Use of \acronym{C/C++} can provide efficiencies, but
#' is cumbersome for interactive data analysis and lacks the flexibility and
#' power of 's rich statistical programming environment.  The package
#' \pkg{bigmemory} and sister packages \pkg{biganalytics}, \pkg{synchronicity},
#' \pkg{bigtabulate}, and \pkg{bigalgebra} bridge this gap, implementing
#' massive matrices and supporting their manipulation and exploration. The data
#' structures may be allocated to shared memory, allowing separate processes on
#' the same computer to share access to a single copy of the data set.  The
#' data structures may also be file-backed, allowing users to easily manage and
#' analyze data sets larger than available RAM and share them across nodes of a
#' cluster. These features of the Bigmemory Project open the door for powerful
#' and memory-efficient parallel analyses and data mining of massive data sets.
#' 
#' This project (\pkg{bigmemory} and its sister packages) is still actively
#' developed, although the design and current features can be viewed as
#' "stable."  Please feel free to email us with any questions:

#' @note Various options are available.
#' \code{options(bigmemory.typecast.warning)} can be set to avoid annoying
#' warnings that might occur if, for example, you assign objects (typically
#' type double) to char, short, or integer \code{\link{big.matrix}} objects.
#' \code{options(bigmemory.print.warning)} protects against extracting and
#' printing a massive matrix (which would involve the creation of a second
#' massive copy of the matrix). \code{options(bigmemory.allow.dimnames)} by
#' default prevents the setting of \code{dimnames} attributes, because they
#' aren't allocated to shared memory and changes will not be visible across
#' processes. \code{options(bigmemory.default.type)} is \code{"double"} be
#' default (a change in default behavior as of 4.1.1) but may be changed by the
#' user.
#' 
#' Versions >=4.0 represent a major redesign, with the mutexes (locking)
#' abstracted to package \pkg{synchronicity}, the exploratory data analysis
#' functionality relocated to package \pkg{biganalytics}, and new linear
#' algebra support available in package \pkg{bigalgebra}.  Package
#' \pkg{bigtabulate} extends the \pkg{bigmemory} package with table-, tapply-,
#' and split-like behavior.  The functions may also be used with regular
#' matrices for speed and memory-efficiency gains. Package \pkg{bigmemory}
#' itself is now minimalist, providing only the core functionality.  As an
#' example, the \code{apply()} method appears in \pkg{biganalytics}, supporting
#' exploration and analysis, while \code{\link{mwhich}}, \code{\link{morder}}
#' and \code{\link{mpermute}} appear in \pkg{bigmemory} as fundamental tools
#' for data manipulation.
#' 
#' Note that you can't simply use a \code{big.matrix} with many (most) existing
#' functions (e.g. \code{\link{lm}}, \code{\link{kmeans}}).  One nice exception
#' is \code{\link{split}}, because this function only accesses subsets of the
#' matrix.
