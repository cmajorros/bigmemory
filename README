# bigmemory
#
# This package is a bit unusual in that the non-Windows version
# supports the use of shared memory, while the Windows version
# only provides the basic support of the massive matrices.
# As a result, the configure moves the relevant shared-memory
# files out of the package, and the clean should put them back
# into place.
#
# We include a sysctl.conf in the package root as an example for
# users.  If this isn't configured correctly, there may be serious
# shared memory limitations.
#
# We also include a script ipc.R which will blow away any and all
# shared memory segments associated with your username.  Use with
# care, but it's useful when something crashes.  Run it with
#      R CMD BATCH ipc.R
